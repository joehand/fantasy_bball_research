I had way too much fun building this. It contains research and data for fantasy basketball. It is very customized to my league settings, but let me know if you want to use it and I can point you in directions of customizing it for you.

## Web App

The best part of this is the web app. It runs with Flask.

## Other stuff

I have data and other iPython analyis notebooks. Maybe I'll add those.

# PRETTY PICTURES!!!

The best part, of course.
